# Mapty-project
A project using Leaflet library, Geolocation API and the Local storage of the web.
The application target is to help a user record his activities which are either running/cycling on a map.
The application will store the user data in the local browser storage and will aim to provide a way for a user to record his activities with details about his activity.

Features:
- Enable web location to log activities based on it.
- Record a cycling/running activity.
- Zoom on each activity by clicking on the activity from the list.
- Eable delete an activity record.

Improving suggestions:
- Modification of an activity
- Adding further information on each activity record
- 

I used to code the project as a part of a coding online course.
