# Mapty-project
A project with using Leaflet library, Geolocation API and the Local storage of the web.
The application target is to help a user his activities which are either running/cycling on a map.
The application will store the user data in the local browser storage and will aim to provide a way for a user to record his activities with details about his activity.


I used to code the project as a part of a coding online course.
